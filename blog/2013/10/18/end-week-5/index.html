<p>This week we had our longest project yet. We built a crowdsourcing app similar to Kickstarter. It was very involved and at times things got frustrating but I worked with two great partners in Kyle and Julian. I feel there are times when it makes sense to work alone but it absolutely makes sense to work with others at other times, especially for large projects! We worked on breaking the whole app down into smaller tasks and assigning them out. It&rsquo;s important to get along with and respect your teammates and these guys were great! There were some times I felt I was struggling to keep up but it kept me motivated to learn more and I hope they enjoyed working with me as well.</p>

<p>Our app allows users to log in and create a profile. Then they can either start their own fundraising campaign and/or donate to someone elses campaign. I think we will win the prize for sweetest layout! I was able to put a status bar on the top of the campaign page that fills up as people donate and I put in a picture carousel that scrolls through pictures that a campaign creator uploads. Julian is working on making the entire background play a video behind all the content, looked really good when he was testing it &ndash; lets see if we can incorporate it in time!</p>

<p>I wanted to add a comment section but ran out of time. But then again, maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t per our class discussion on app development best practices. Nimit and David recommended we read a book called Getting Real by 37 Signals which is the company that developed Rails. In it there is an reference to the &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; philosophy and we should not try to put too much in an app just because we can. Focusing on the &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; and omitting the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t needs&rdquo; will lead to a more elegant design. Although, while we are just learning, I admit it&rsquo;s fun to add in cool things like a video background, comment section, a robot monkey that can do your taxes, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>Overall I am starting to see the power of the Rails framework and I like how we took the time for an &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; approach to understanding it. I hope to go through Michael Hartl&rsquo;s tutorial on it again soon and reinforce what I&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>

<p>P.S. We have not pushed our crowdsourcing app to the internet yet but will post a link when we do. I was pushing to name it FullTilt (a cross between Fullstack Academy and CrowdTilt) but we settled on Crowdcontrol.</p>
