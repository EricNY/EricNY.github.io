<p>It&rsquo;s true. Time sure flies when you are having fun. Today marks the end of the fourth week so that means we have 2/3 rds of the course to go. I still have a lot to learn but I feel we have come a long way since day 1. But then I suppose the learning will never stop so I should take time and appreciate what we&rsquo;ve done so far.</p>

<p>This week we started building actual rails apps, here is my first one: (<a href="http://shrouded-meadow-3132.herokuapp.com/rooms/1">http://shrouded-meadow-3132.herokuapp.com/rooms/1</a>). All the pieces we have been learning are coming together and I need more practice but it is pretty satisfying to see something I do actually work. OK, there are some bugs but I know how to fix them and maybe I&rsquo;ll go back to this one in my spare time. But for now we got to keep going as the class moves pretty fast!</p>
