<p>OK. Week 3 has come and gone and things are getting intense. We started taking the different pieces we have been learning and putting them together. The projects are getting more difficult but I am starting to see the bigger picture of what is involved with web development and its very exciting.</p>

<p>This week we used ActiveRecord and SQL to access more IMDB data. We had to write code for an empty model.</p>

<p>We also used Sinatra to build our first fully functioning web app. We call it Stackworld where a user can add a personal profile and create their own world where different rooms can link to eachother and they can navigate through the world.</p>

<p>Lastly, we brushed up on regular expressions and we just got our new exciting which I feel will be difficult but its a really cool thing to know. We will be building a web crawler which will allow us to scrape websites for data and create a graph using that data. Apparently this is some serious technology so we all made a pact to use our new powers for good instead of evil:)</p>
