    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OK. Week 3 has come and gone and things are getting intense. We started taking the different pieces we have been learning and putting them together. The projects are getting more difficult but I am starting to see the bigger picture of what is involved with web development and its very exciting.</p>

<p>This week we used ActiveRecord and SQL to access more IMDB data. We had to write code for an empty model.</p>

<p>We also used Sinatra to build our first fully functioning web app. We call it Stackworld where a user can add a personal profile and create their own world where different rooms can link to eachother and they can navigate through the world.</p>

<p>Lastly, we brushed up on regular expressions and we just got our new exciting which I feel will be difficult but its a really cool thing to know. We will be building a web crawler which will allow us to scrape websites for data and create a graph using that data. Apparently this is some serious technology so we all made a pact to use our new powers for good instead of evil:)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello all,</p>

<p>We are finishing up week 2 here at Fullstack Academy and I couldnt be happier! This week we wrote an AI program that plays Blackjack, we worked on getting a basic working knowledge of SQL, and we learned how to use Ruby code to connect to and query an SQLite database of IMDB data.</p>

<p>For the Blackjack program it was more TDD as we partnered up with another class member. The SQL exercises started very basic but the last few and the extra credit got a little hairy. Now I know just how complex SQL queries can become but its fun to puzzle the pieces together. Using Ruby to connect to a database was very interesting as well. It really helped for me to start putting the pieces together of the various disciplines involved in web development.</p>

<p>This weekend I hope to review various rails tutorials as well as my mailer program which is what I use to send my weekly updates to my blog subscribers. I dont have it working exactly as it should just yet.</p>

<p>Until next time!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are wrapping up week one here at Fullstack and I think we covered a good amount of work but I feel like it will only get more intense from here. Something tells me there will be many evenings where I dont get home until verrry late:)</p>

<p>The most interesting thing we did this week was probably our mailer assignment from yesterday. We got to use CSV files, .erb files, Ruby and HTML and we had to make them all work together. The final result was to be able to send an email or text to a list of friends notifying them of our latest blog entry.</p>

<p>Something I struggle with is understanding what is going on with the code we are writing, specifically for this mailer assignment. While it is very interesting stuff and the code I wrote works I feel I do not have a deep understanding of what we just did. I want to review this project when I get the chance.</p>

<p>I like the format of the class. David and Nimit give us enough lecture time so we cover various concepts but we also have plenty of time to actually get down to business and work through coding challenges ourselves.</p>

<p>Pair programming is new to me but I can see the benefits. Sometimes it was unclear which one of us was in the driver&rsquo;s seat as we talked through problems but it definitely helps to have a sounding board for your ideas as we are working through a challenge together.</p>

<p>This weekend I plan on reviewing what we did in class this week as well as some of the pre-work.</p>
